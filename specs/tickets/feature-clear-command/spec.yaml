title: Add /clear command to reset chat history

type: feature

description: |
  A new `/clear` command is needed to reset the chat history, allowing users to start a fresh conversation without restarting the terminal. This is useful when the context gets cluttered or when switching to a completely different topic.

acceptance_criteria:
  - When the user enters the `/clear` command, only the conversation history (messages between user and AI) is reset.
  - After clearing the history, a confirmation message "Chat history cleared." is displayed to the user.
  - System context, such as loaded project files, remains available and is not affected by the command.

implementation_scope:
  frontend: []
  backend: []

technical_notes: |
  The command must specifically target and wipe only the conversational message history. It must not interfere with or unload any other system-level context, data, or project files that are active in the session.
