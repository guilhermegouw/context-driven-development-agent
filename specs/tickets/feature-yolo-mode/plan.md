# Implementation Plan: YOLO Mode

**Ticket:** `feature-yolo-mode`
**Type:** feature
**Complexity:** medium
**Created:** 2025-12-05

---

## Overview

Implement YOLO mode as a third execution mode that enables fully autonomous tool execution without confirmation prompts. The implementation extends the existing ExecutionMode enum, updates the mode cycling logic from binary to ternary, and integrates with the approval system to auto-approve all tool executions while maintaining error handling.

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add YOLO mode to ExecutionMode enum

**Description:** Extend the ExecutionMode enum in the execution state module to include YOLO as a third mode alongside NORMAL and PLAN. This is the foundation for all subsequent YOLO mode functionality.

**Complexity:** simple
**Dependencies:** None

**Files Affected:**
- `src/cdd_agent/utils/execution_state.py`

---

### Step 2: Update mode cycling logic to cycle through three modes

**Description:** Modify the Shift+Tab keybinding handler to cycle through all three modes (NORMAL → PLAN → YOLO → NORMAL) instead of the current binary toggle. This involves updating the keybinding event handler in the TUI.

**Complexity:** medium
**Dependencies:** Step 1

**Files Affected:**
- `src/cdd_agent/tui.py`

---

### Step 3: Update TUI mode indicator to show YOLO mode

**Description:** Modify the mode indicator display in the TUI to show 'YOLO MODE' with a distinctive icon (🚀) when YOLO mode is active. This requires updating the UI rendering logic.

**Complexity:** simple
**Dependencies:** Step 1

**Files Affected:**
- `src/cdd_agent/tui.py`

---

### Step 4: Integrate YOLO mode with approval system

**Description:** Modify the approval logic to auto-approve all tool executions when in YOLO mode. The approval system already checks the execution_mode property, so this involves updating the approval logic to bypass prompts and return auto-approval for YOLO mode.

**Complexity:** medium
**Dependencies:** Step 1

**Files Affected:**
- `src/cdd_agent/approval.py`

---

### Step 5: Add tests for YOLO mode functionality

**Description:** Create comprehensive tests to verify YOLO mode behavior, including mode cycling, auto-approval of tools, and proper error handling when tool execution fails. Ensure existing tests continue to pass.

**Complexity:** medium
**Dependencies:** Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, Step 4

**Files Affected:**
- `tests/test_execution_mode.py`
- `tests/test_approval.py`
- `tests/test_approval_integration.py`

---

## Risks & Considerations

- Auto-approval in YOLO mode could potentially execute dangerous commands without user oversight, requiring careful implementation and clear user feedback about the active mode

---

## Next Steps

To execute this plan:

```bash
/exec feature-yolo-mode
```
